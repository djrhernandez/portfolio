										<p>Senior Software Engineer</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Designed scalable tool-agnostic frameworks that fetched, stored, standardized, and
												supplied vast amounts of data to various environments to present accurate and reliable
												information in an timely, automated fashion.
											</li>
											<li>
												Designed multiple backend applications in Ruby for a responsive internal website, allowing
												hundreds of stakeholders to readily observe, analyze, and report quantifiable metrics pertaining
												to incident management, infrastructure costs, service dependencies, cascading service failures,
												and other complex workflows within company operations in real-time.
											</li>
											<li>
												Built a backend monitoring application in Ruby that enabled a holistic view of system and network
												stability across the company. The application would aggregate information from multiple sources to
												automatically detect which and how often services interact with each other, infer their dependencies
												and relationships, and inform stakeholders about the current state of systems.
											</li>
											<li>
												Developed other backend features that bolster performance for various data storage, transformation,
												and transfer capabilities. Features included Redis caching for immediate data availability, integration
												with AWS products such as S3, RDS, and SQS for data storage and ingestion, Sidekiq workers for
												asynchronous background processing, and automated tooling for onboarded service teams using platforms
												such as Rundeck.
											</li>
											<li>
												Built complex CI/CD tooling using E2E automation leveraging tools such as Git, Jenkins, Spinnaker,
												Artifactory, Terraform and Kubernetes to implement, manage, and configure resource provisioning for the
												application deployment pipeline. Improvements to the pipeline resulted in a 15% decrease for infrastructure
												costs and AWS provisioning.
											</li>
										</ul>

									<div className='subtext'>
										<p>Operational Reliability & Automation Engineer</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Designed solutions that provided reliable automated systems focused on scalability, availability, and efficiency
												across all company operations. Visualized processes that teams used to help qualify and quantify improvements to
												their workflows. Tied the health of their team into the health of the organization as a whole.
											</li>
											<li>
												Constructed a robust API under a GraphQL layer to integrate RESTful web services with front-end backbone code and
												provide internal tooling the ability to pull data from multiple sources. The API utilized background processing jobs
												via Sidekiq to perform tasks, such as concurrent viewership of key linear events (i.e. Superbowl, Fashion week) or
												incident response notifications, and provide highly accessible data on demand.
											</li>
											<li>
												Constructed self-service Slack automation that supported general and on-call support through the use of YAML files.
												These Slack bots were developed to reduce excess operational work and improve the reliability of systems so teams can
												be more efficient with their daily operations. As a result, the applications cultivated a cohesive and standardized
												system of communication between stakeholders, allowing teams to dictate the processing of their workflows and improve
												their incident metrics by 50% once they were onboarded.
											</li>

										<p>Network Operations Center (NOC) Incident Manager</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Marshaled internal teams to mitigate and restore critical network, application, and system incidents that severely impact
												stakeholders to the company. Corroborated disaster recovery plans to triage and analyze outages within the organizationâ€™s
												infrastructure.
											</li>
											<li>
												Improved the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of network traffic and software deployment monitoring to automated
												intelligent detection systems, resulting in an increase of incident-free time by 5.21% in a six-month period.
